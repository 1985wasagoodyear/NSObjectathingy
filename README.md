# Objective

To create an app wherein each individual high-level subtask that is able to be described to a layman (signing in, saving, loading, etc), is purely and abstractly defined as an NSOperation-the abstract object used to describe code and data associated to a task.


# Motivation:

1. To better understand the usage of NSOperations and apply them for use, as well-described in WWDC 2015 by Apple.

2. To write more well-defined applications, wherein the source better describes individual procedures and tasks by namespacing and self-containing them within a succinct object and not burden them by their technical requirements or system-level burdens, obfuscating their intent.


# List of all Tasks:

1. Sign in
2. Load data
3. Present UI
4. Create new data
5. Update UI
6. Save data
7. Sign out
8. Navigation
9. Present Error & Success Alerts
